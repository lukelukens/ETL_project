ETL Project Write-Up

Pulls active COVID-19 data from an online repository, using a live URL. 
The data pulled does not included all-country stats for every single country and also includes specific cities for others. 
I separate the data into four databases: 
	one that gives each location a unique key
	one that includes only states
	one that includes only cities
	one that includes only countries
The final database required a groupby, because where states were provided, all-country numbers were not. 
The groupby groups and sums the states to return all-country statistics. 

I sent that data to SQL, using a replace, because the data is being updated live.
